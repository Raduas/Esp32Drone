# ESP32 drone - Learning project 

This my first bigger project on ESP32 where i want learn JS,html,csss,C,git.   7,4V (2x 18650 on serial)

## v1:
-motors are scrapped from another dron which didn't work
-developed GUI joystick on websocket which are used for control drone
-basic drive function from power (left joystick Y axis) to PWM which are drive MOSFETS
-first wiring on breadboard

-Developed first 3D printed body (2 top and bottom layers, 2 perimeters, 5% infill)
-- body are from 2 part, which are motorholder a body

### v1 conclusion: 
motors are works as i want, but printed body with breadboard are too heavy for lift.

## v2: -on proggress
-from breaboard moved to soldering field
-new 3D printed body (2 top and bottom layers, 1 perimeters, 0% infill)
--made from atleas 4 part which are connect by adhesive
    
## what next:
  ### on v2:
  -control function for roll, yaw, pitch 
  ### on v3:
  -IMU for self stabilization

     
vision for next upgrade on next versions
  -Doppler radar + gps for Autonomous drive to point
